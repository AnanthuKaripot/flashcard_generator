# NEET PG Flashcard Pipeline

This project automates the generation of high-quality, branded flashcards for NEET PG preparation and provides a mobile-first web application for reviewing them.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`flashcard_generator.py`**: The core Python script that transforms JSON data into stylized flashcard images using the Pillow library.
- **`web_app/`**: Contains the source code for the flashcard viewer.
    - `index.html`: The main entry point for the web app.
    - `assets/`: Contains static assets like the logo (`logo.png`).
    - `daily_flashcards.json`: The data source fetched by the web app (generated by n8n or the script).
- **`assets/`**: Shared assets for the Python script (fonts, logos, backgrounds).
- **`Flashcard_Workflow.json`**: An n8n workflow file used to automate the data fetch and generation process.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

1.  **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Requires `numpy` and `Pillow`)*

## 🛠 Usage

### Generating Flashcards manually
Run the generator script to create images from your JSON source:
```bash
python flashcard_generator.py
```
*Note: Ensure your input JSON source is configured correctly in the script.*

### The Web App
The `web_app/index.html` is designed to be hosted (e.g., GitHub Pages).
- It fetches `daily_flashcards.json` dynamically.
- Shows a branded loading screen.
- Features a simple "Tap to Flip" interface.

## ⚙️ Customization

- **Branding**: Replace `web_app/assets/logo.png` and `assets/logo.png` with your own.
- **Colors**: Edit the CSS variables in `web_app/index.html` (`:root` section).
- **Output**: Output directory is currently set to a local `.n8n-files` path in the script configuration.

## 🔄 Deployment Workflow (n8n)
1.  n8n fetches question data.
2.  Data is formatted into the expected JSON structure.
3.  The Python script creates the images.
4.  JSON and Images are committed to the GitHub repository.
5.  GitHub Pages serves the `web_app` folder.
